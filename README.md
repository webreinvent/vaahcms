> **[VaahCMS](https://vaah.dev/cms)** is an open-source web application development platform shipped with headless content management system.

<br/>

**VaahCMS** is built  with `Laravel 10`, `Vue 3`, `Pinia`, and `PrimeVue` which follows **Hierarchical Model View Controller (HMVC)** architectural pattern which supports multiple **Modules** and **Themes**. Each module and theme can be setup with just `blade` files support or can have its own frontend JavaScript library e.g. `Vue` or `React`.

## Quick Start
```shell
npx vaah cms:install
```

## Why VaahCMS?

How many times have you used a CMS to build website and Laravel for application development? **Everytime, isn't it?**

Well, not next time. Use `VaahCMS` in your next project and develop applications with content management that doesn't come in your way.

## How is VaahCMS different?

- Its purpose is to develop enterprise level software applications which are `manageable`,  `extendable`, `flexible`, `upgradable`, & `maintainable` in long run

- (**HMVC Architectural Pattern**) Structured modules & themes

- Isolated `Vue` or `React` App for each Module & Theme

- Shipped with **headless** CMS with build in API, so you can plug and play with any frontend framework `like Nuxt` or `Next`.

- `CMS Module` is inspired from the simplicity of WordPress
